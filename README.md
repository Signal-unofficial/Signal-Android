## Building From Source

- Install Docker Desktop
- Run `docker compose run -d --rm build` to create an `.aab` bundle.
  Note that when building from scratch,
  this operation takes at least an hour and 15GB of memory.
  - If your PC doesn't have at least 15GB of RAM (double recommended,
    since your host needs memory, too), then this cannot be done.
    Instead, you'll need to perform a manual installation. Good luck.
    You will need to install:
    - Git
    - Java 17+
    - Android SDK 12.0+ (or the much larger Android Studio app that includes it)
    The `build` stage of the relevant [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) contains steps
    for installing these tools on Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble), as well as running the build itself.
    If ever this information is incorrect or outdated, see the Dockerfile instead.
  - If your PC does meet this memory requirement, but Docker doesn't use
    that much memory (defaults to 50% of the maximum host memory), see:
    [raising the Docker memory limit](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings-and-maintenance/settings/#advanced).
- When the build completes, run `docker compose run -d --rm package`
  to create unsigned `.apk` files in [`splits`](./app/build/outputs/apks/splits).
  This operation is significantly faster.
- Run `./gen-keystore` to generate the keys necessary for signing the APKs.
  Use a unique, secure password that you'll remember, as you'll
  need it in later steps. Note that in a production setting, this file would
  not be regenerated frequently, but rather reused until its expiry nears.
- Remove the `.example` file extension from all [`secrets`](./reproducible-builds/secrets/)
  and change the contents to make them your own, for security purposes.
- Run `docker compose run -it --rm sign` to sign the APKs through the console.
  Feel free to backup the unsigned APKs in another folder.
- Run `docker compose up -d run` to run an emulator with the APKs installed.
  Docker will expose the emulator on a random port
  (e.g, the `50000` in `50000:8000`), making it accessible in your browser
  (i.e, `localhost:50000`).
